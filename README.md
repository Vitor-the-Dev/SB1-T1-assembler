# Assembler for a Made-up Language #
==============================================================================

This is a small project developed as part of the Basic Software course at UnB (University of Bras√≠lia). The assignment involves creating a simple assembler in C++ to translate a program written in a custom assembly language.

## Usage
Build the project:

- Run make run to compile the project. This will produce an executable named Montador (meaning "Assembler" in Portuguese).

Assemble your code:
- Run the assembler with the following command:

```bash
./Montador [your_project_file]

```
- Replace [your_project_file] with the path to your assembly source code file. This will assemble the code and generate the corresponding machine code.

## Dependencies

- The assembler is a standalone application and does not require external libraries, relying solely on the C++ standard libraries.
